# Synthetic-Image-Generation

This repository deals with synthetic image generation using Deep Convoluted General Adverserial Network (DCGAN). The main dataset used in this repository is the pre-defined <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist"> Fashion MNIST </a> dataset.

This dataset primarily uses DCGAN(Deep Convoluted Generative Adverserial Network).

## Installations ## 

This project uses **Python 3.x**, so a suitable python version (>=3.6) is advisable.

The project uses the following frameworks:- 
<ul>
  <li> tensorflow </li>
</ul>

## Local Machine installation ##
If you do not have a working installation of these packages, the easiest way to install scikit-learn is using `pip`

`pip install <package name >`

or `conda`:

`conda install <package name>`

## Project Motivation ## 

The Max-min strategy of GAN was very interesting which led me to this project.

## Summary of the Result ##

This is a Computer Vision Project which uses deep convoluted neural network to generate Images that are close to the real dataset.

##  File Descriptions ##

There are two working files and an image file in this repository.

The Jupyter notebook (IRIS_Classification.ipynb) file contains the project.

The image(.png) file is used to supplement the Jupyter notebook. (Source : Google images)
